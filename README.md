A utility mod for MunchyMC that helps you track cooldowns, monitor your mining/fishing income, and get better special item hints than /thrift.

## Configuration GUI

This mod uses [YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl?version=1.21.5&loader=fabric) for its configuration GUI.

**YACL is required for the config menu. If you do not have it installed, the game will crash when you try to open /mu config.**

Open the config screen with `/mu config` or from Mod Menu. All features and HUDs are configurable here.

### Config Tabs
- **General:** Update checker, chat suppression, HUD layout (Edit HUD Layout, Reset HUD Locations)
- **Cooldown Triggers:** Manage custom cooldown triggers
- **FishingHud:** Fishing HUD options
- **MiningHud:** Mining HUD options

## Features

### Info HUD (Mining & Fishing)

- **Income Tracking:** Real-time income per hour, session stats, and AFK time
- **Session Management:** Automatic timeout after inactivity, manual reset, and summary
- **AFK Detection:** Pauses session when you are away (1 minute idle)
- **Fishing HUD:** Tracks fishing XP, rewards, level, time to next level, and casts
- **Mining HUD:** Tracks mining income and session stats
- **Hotbar Tool Detection:** Only shows the relevant HUD if you have a pickaxe or fishing rod in your hotbar
- **Porg Buff Tracking:** Right-clicking Roasted Porg gives a 2-minute buff, shown in the HUD. Optionally prevents use if already active.

### Cooldown HUD

- **Default Triggers:** Pre-configured for popular items (Dooku, Scrubee, Moloch's, etc.)

### Freethrift Item Lookup

- **Item Info Lookup:** Instantly view effects and usage of rare/special items
- **Flexible Search:** Hold an item or use `/mu freethrift <item_tag>`, or hold the item and type `/mu freethrift`.
- **Community Contributions:** Add missing items via GitHub

### HUD Customization

### Chat Suppression
- **Hide Inventory Full/Sell Success:** Suppress these messages via the General tab in the config GUI.

## Commands

```sh
/mu trigger add <name> <held|worn> <crouch|rclick|lclick|break> <itemNamePart> <cooldownSeconds>
/mu trigger remove <name>
/mu trigger list
```

/mu summary true             # Show and copy statistics to clipboard
```

### Freethrift Item Lookup

```sh
/mu freethrift               # Look up the item you're holding
/mu freethrift <item_tag>    # Look up a specific item by tag (auto-suggested)
/mu freethrift <item_tag> true # Look up and copy info to clipboard
```

### Help

```sh

```

### Feature Control

Feature toggling is now handled in the config GUI (open with `/mu config` or from Mod Menu).

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Item Names with Spaces**: Use quotes for item names containing spaces or special characters:

   ```sh
   /mu trigger add "Luga's Net" held rclick "Luga's Net" 900
   ```

2. **HUD Positioning**:
   - Hold TAB to switch between moving cooldown and info HUDs
   - Use arrow keys for precise positioning
   - HUDs snap to a 10-pixel grid for clean alignment
   - Use the General tab in config to move or reset HUDs
3. **AFK Detection**:
   - Automatically detects when you're not moving or using controls (1 minute idle)
   - Pauses session and income tracking during AFK
   - Resumes automatically when you return
4. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions automatically reset if no income changes for 2 minutes (mining) or 3m30s (fishing)
   - Use `/mu reset` to manually start a new session
   - Get a summary anytime with `/mu summary`

## Default Triggers

The mod comes with several pre-configured triggers for popular items:

- Dooku Pickaxe (25 minutes)
- Scrubee Head (80 minutes)
- Moloch's Scythe (2 hours)
- Yoda's Pickaxe (20 minutes)
- Zadkiel's Sacred Pickaxe (1 hour)
- Luga's Net (15 minutes)
- and more...

You can modify or remove these defaults using the config GUI (open with `/mu config` or from Mod Menu).
